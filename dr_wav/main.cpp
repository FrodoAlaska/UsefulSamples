  /// buffer you just allocated. It will return the number of frames read.

  /// This function is supposed to be used inside an audio callback. The buffer will have to

  /// amount of samples that were _actually_ read by the buffer, is a _very_ useful information

  ///
  /// Mainly, `_f32` and `_s16`. The floating-point format is usually more "clean" and has a better quality. 
  /// However, as you would have guessed, it takes up more memory especially if the WAV file contains lots of samples.

  /// total PCM frames that have been read.
  ///
  /// The function below will read the PCM frames as floating-point values. Even if the internal 
  /// WAV file is not represented as floating-point, dr_wav will make sure to convert it to floating-point.
  ///
  /// However, dr_wav also supports reading the PCM frames of a WAV file in a signed 2 byte format (or a `short`). 
  /// For that, you can use the `drwav_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s16` function, which accepts the same parameters.
  /// The only difference here is in the return value. Instead of a `float*` return value, the `drwav_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s16` 
  /// function will return, you guessed it, `short*`. 
  ///
  /// There is also the `drwav_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s32` variant which will read the PCM frames of a WAV 
  /// file and return an array of `int`s (`int*`).
  ///
  /// This kind of operation is very useful for when you just want to read the whole entire PCM frames in one 
  /// go and save it off to your own format, for example. Or, perhaps, you know that the WAV file is small 
  /// and you can read it in one go.
